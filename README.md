Josh-

-Started on UDPServer and UDPClient getting majority of it completed have a quote print every 10 seconds, need to have them interact with \<REQUESTQUOTE\> command

-Worked on UDPClient interacting with UDPServer.

-Got the date working, just need it formatted correctly.




How to Run:
1. Once you download the files you want to make sure the quotes.csv file is in the same directory.
2. You need to start the UDPServer first and make sure it is running before proceeding. 
3. Next you can compile and run UDPClient and type UDPClient \<ip\> \<port\> (Note: the port number should be 2015)
4. From here you can request a quote with the command \<REQUESTQUOTE\> and the server will send a quote back which the client will return
5. After the quote is printed you can continue to use \<REQUESTQUOTE\> as needed and it will deplay the time and date of the message.
6. If you would like to end, type the \<END\> command.
